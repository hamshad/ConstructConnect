    "projectDescription": "The Scope of Work to include, but not limited to: Removal, transport and installation of four DSA approved 24' x 40' District relocatable classroom buildings currently located at Lark Ellen Elementary School or Sierra Vista Middle School, associated site work, electrical, power and signal, and fire hydrant. Restroom upgrades to Building B, men's and women's and Building D, boy's and girl's restrooms.\n\nThe lowest bid shall be the lowest bid price on the base bid without consideration of the prices on the additive or deductive items. The District required that bidder possess a Class B License at the time the contract is awarded. If the license classification specified herein is that of a \"specialty contractor\" the specialty contractor awarded the contract for this work shall itself construct a majority of the work. All work must be completed within Ninety ( 90 ) consecutive calendar days from the date stated in the Notice to Proceed. Failure to complete the work within the time set forth herein will result in the imposition of liquidated damages for each day of delay as specified in the Information for Bidders form. If the bid is accepted, the bidder shall perform at least 15% of the work, exclusive of supervisory and clerical work, without the services of any subcontractor. The bidder shall include the tasks the bidder will perform to meet the 15% requirement. Each bidder will be encouraged and expected to exercise due diligence to meet the state-wide and District participation goal for disabled veteran business enterprises (\"DVBE\") of not less than 3% per year of the overall dollar amount of funds allocated to the District by the State Allocation Board. Bidders shall submit to the District with the Bid Form, the completed and executed DVBE Participation Goal Compliance form. In addition, within five (5) calendar days following the date in which the low bidder is declared or two (2) calendar days prior to the scheduled award of the Project, whichever is sooner, the successful bidder shall submit to the District the appropriate DVBE Compliance Forms.\n\nEach Bid shall be accompanied by a certified or cashier's check or bid bond executed by an admitted surety insurer in an amount not less than 10% of the total bid price, payable to the District. A Payment Bond and a Performance Bond will be required from the successful bidder prior to execution of the contract and must be in the form set forth in the contract documents. In addition, the successful bidder shall require subcontractors who will provide labor and materials in excess of $50,000 to supply a Payment Bond and a Performance Bond prior to the execution of any work on the Project. The District reserves the right to extend the bid closing date, reject any or all bids or to waive any irregularities or information in any bids or in the bidding. The Contractor and all subcontractors shall comply with the requirements set forth in Division 2, Part 7, Chapter 1 of the Labor Code. The District has obtained from the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations the general prevailing rate of per diem wages and the general prevailing rate for holiday and overtime work in the locality in which this work is to be performed for each craft, classification or type of worker needed to execute the Contract. These per diem rates, including holiday and overtime work, as well as employer payments for health and welfare,pension, vacation, and similar purposes, are on file at the District, and are also available from the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations. Pursuant to California Labor Code section 1720 et seq., it shall be mandatory upon the Contractor to whom the Contract is awarded, and upon any subcontractor under such Contractor, to pay not less than the said specified rates to all workers employed by them in the execution of the Contract. A contractor or subcontractor shall not be qualified to bid on, be listed in a bid proposal, subject to the requirements of Section 4104 of the Public Contract Code, or engage in the performance of any contract for public work, as defined in the Labor Code, unless currently registered and qualified to perform public work pursuant to Labor Code section 1725.5. It is not a violation of this section for an unregistered contractor to submit a bid that is authorized by Section 7029.1 of the Business and Professions Code or by Section 10164 or 20103.5 of the Public Contract Code, provided the contractor is registered to perform public work pursuant to Section 1725.5 at the time the contract is awarded. The Contractor and all subcontractors shall furnish certified payroll records as required pursuant Labor Code section 1776 directly to the Labor Commissioner in accordance with Labor Code section 1771.4 on at least on a monthly basis (or more frequently if required by the District or the Labor Commissioner) and in a format prescribed by the Labor Commissioner. Monitoring and enforcement of the prevailing wage laws and related requirements will be performed by the Labor Commissioner/ Department of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE).

    "projectDescription": "As of March 2019, construction documents are complete, however the project is on hold for funding. This will be a tiered bid project. The first tier is for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and the second tier is for Veteran-Owned businesses. The third tier will be for the most competitive bid. A firm timeline cannot currently be established.\n\nThe original solicitation is preserved below for reference.\n\n*Contract Award Date:\nAugust 29, 2017\nContract Award Number:\nVA261-17-C-0146\nContract Award Dollar Amount:\n$42,988.75\nContractor Awarded DUNS:\n027730157\nContractor Awardee:\nVALHALLA ENGINEERING GROUP, LLC;10333 E DRY CREEK RD SUITE 200;ENGLEWOOD;CO;80112\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs VA Central California Health Care System, CA (VACCHCS) is seeking Architectural/Engineering Firms to submit Standard Form (SF) 330 for Project No. 570-17-408, Project Title Install Skytron Ceiling Mount Boom Surgical Suite, Building 1. The project will be located at the VACCHCS Fresno Campus. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541310, Architectural Services, and the small business size standard is $7.5 million. \n\nThis design effort includes, but is not limited to installation of the already procured Skytron Ergon Boom in the surgical suite. The AE s design shall encompass four (4) Skytron heavy duty central tandem overhead boom systems (ECT2F-C_/2AF_AUT75) with two arm sets on one hub and two surgical lights, each of which shall have the capacity to hold the upper arm set of each overhead boom, in addition to the lower arm.\n,\nThe contract work requires multiple disciplines. The Prime firm shall be a licensed/registered professional firm. The disciplines required include, but are not limited to: Architectural, Civil, Interior Design, Structural, HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Fire Life Safety, Security, IT/Data, Construction Cost Estimating, and Signage/Way-Finding. \n\nThis procurement is a total Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside under the Veterans First Contracting program as required by 38 U.S.C. 8127-8128, as implemented under VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) subpart 819.70. The term Service-disabled Veteran-Owned small business (SDVOSB) under the Veterans First Contracting program has the same meaning as service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern defined in FAR subpart 2.101, except for acquisitions authorized by 38 U.S.C. 8127 and 8128 for the Veterans First Contracting Program. These businesses must be listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov in addition to meeting the NAICS code small business size standard to be eligible for award under the Veterans First Contracting Program. \n\nAll SDVOSB firms that submit Standard Form (SF) 330s must be listed in Veterans Information Page (VIP) as verified to be considered for this procurement. Offers from unverified SDVOSBs are considered deficient and will not be evaluated further. A firm s status will be verified in VIP at time of receipt of the SF 330, prior to conducting evaluations/interviews/discussions, and prior to award. This set aside process is in keeping with VA Procurement Policy Memorandum 2016-05 Implementation of the Veterans First Contracting Program, FAR Part 19, and the requirements of FAR 36.6 for acquiring Architect-Engineer Services. \n\n\nThe SF-330, Part I may be accompanied by any other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant.

    "projectDescription": "1,2,3- TCP is a chlorinated hydrocarbon with high chemical stability. It is a manmade chemical found at industrial or hazardous waste sites. It has been used as a cleaning and degreasing solvent and also is associated with pesticide products. Currently, there are 7 wells inactive due to traces of 1,2,3 - TCP. This project will provide funding for rehabilitation for those wells by evaluating treatment and non-treatment and the possibility of even replacement of a well.\n\n\nThis project is included in the City of Modesto's FY 2022-2027 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP).  As of April 4, 2023, information regarding a design team or a general contractor is not available.  A timeline for construction has not been determined.\n\n\n*Project information has been obtained through a public capital improvement plan (CIP). A CIP is a financial schedule for short- and long-range projects which is updated regularly. Information listed in the CIP often evolves based on funding availability and the project details, including timeline and value, are subject to change. The content management team will continue to pursue additional details as they become available.",
